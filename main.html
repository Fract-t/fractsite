<p>Hi there! I'm Fract and I really like computers!</p>

<p>Trying to decentralize the net, one site at a time!</p>

<p>I made this webpage as an exercise for practicing html as well as just a pet project to have fun with :D I truly belive in a less centralized internet, with more personal sites instead of everyone congregating on social media platforms such as instagram, twitter etc. I have no idea what kind of things will end up on this site but I'm excited for whats to come. Thanks for stopping here and reading my silly ramblings! Have a good day!</p>
