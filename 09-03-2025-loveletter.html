    <h1>A love letter to the 1050 Ti</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>09/03/2025 14:14</h2>
    <br>
    <p>It’s the summer of 2017. I sit at the dining room table with a few family members, with a video call open to my brother's dad. His name is Charlie and he has been helping me in my recent endeavours towards building my first desktop PC. Piece by piece he guides me through the assembly, all parts he had helped me acquire at their lowest market rates. The final piece is installed, an evga 1050 Ti 4Gb Graphics card. Even back then it was nowhere near top of the line, a year old midrange card, but it was mine. I set up all the external cables and pressed the power button.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Moving from a refurbished decade old laptop to this was huge. I went from not even having a 64 bit processor to having dedicated graphics. Garry's Mod, Skyrim, Fallout New Vegas, Minecraft with over 300 mods. Anything seemed possible compared to before. My friend may have had shorter load times and better framerates with his 1080 Ti but I was finally able to even boot the games he was playing.</p>

    <p>Now moving forward a few years, the 30 series cards are all the rage but due to pandemic economics and the ever present rise of crypto miners in their quest to scalp the entire GPU market I have no chance of acquiring one. I would be lying if I said I didnt want to purchase one, but being at this point barely a teenager and jobless meant that with the current market it was hopeless. Still my 1050 Ti stood strong. I even ran an oculus rift S headset off the card and with most games it was playable, not amazing, but playable. </p>

    <p>It wasn’t so long ago that Charlie gifted me his old 1070, a moderate upgrade from my now worn out and severely outdated card. The 1070 itself is practically ancient when I look at the new 50 series cards. But the market to this day is messy, if you can even track down a card in stock, it’s likely to be marked up to some ridiculous degree. Now as barely an adult with a job I can start putting away some money for a new card but even thats uncertain. For now, my 1070 does its job, just as the 1050 Ti did its job for so many years.</p>
    <br>
    <p>1050 Ti, thank you for letting me experience gaming. Thank you for teaching me some patience. Thank you for not being a thousand dollars. Thank you for making real frames, not Ai frame generation tomfoolery. Thank you for still being in my closet in case something else breaks. Thank you for your service 1050 Ti, and may you have a good retirement.</p>
